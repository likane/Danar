      <h3>The Story</h3>
      <p>Whether it was going to Springteen shows in an empty room for two bucks in the early 70's or doing sound at CBGB's in the 70's and 80's, I've always been attracted to new music and how it gets heard. Lately I've been spending a lot of time in Los Angeles, involved with a groundbreaking radio station-KCRW. "Altered States" evolved from the affiliation.</p>
